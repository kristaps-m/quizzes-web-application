For newer Node you might run into problems :(

Running into a common issue with Webpacker + Node 17+ and newer (especially Node 18+ and 20+). The key line here is:

Error: error:0308010C:digital envelope routines::unsupported

This happens because Node.js 17 and above changed how OpenSSL works, and Webpack 4 (used by Webpacker 5 in Rails 6) doesnâ€™t support those changes.
